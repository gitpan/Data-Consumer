Revision history for Data-Consumer

0.14    Sun Oct 12 2014
        Reset the 'fail' flag before processing any new item

0.13    Mon Jul 18 2011
        Fixed bug in leave() implementation: The status for 'unprocessed'
        could previously not be '0'.

0.12    Fri Mar 27 2011
        Note in documentation that an explicit lock_prefix should almost
        always be specified.

0.11    Fri Mar 27 2011
        Fix SELECT GET_LOCK order-of-evaluation issue.
        This is an important bug fix if you're running Data::Consumer in
        a pipeline-fashion with multiple consumers working on items in
        various stages. If in doubt, upgrade.

0.10 
        Lots of changes. Fixed an important bug and disabled the broken sweep
        functionality for now. Also silence some warnings on older perls.

0.09
        Added support for 'leave', 'ignore', 'fail' and 'halt'. They probably
        could be better documented and tested.

0.08
        Pretty close to ready for release. Cleaned up pod and perltidied
        the code (my current parameters of choice are in comments in .pm 
        files). Spent some time on the make process to have configurable
        mysql arguments, which default to off for automated processed.

0.01    2008-02-10
        Initial creation. Support Mysql and File based data resources.
